A simple set of Dotfiles for use as an introduction to vim. I have included
only configurations that I see as objectively "good".

## Ussage

I recomend you create your own repository from scratch rather than forking this
one. Then, look through the files here and duplicate the lines that look useful
to you.

Your dotfiles should only include configurations that you both understand and
need. I would encourage you to be verbose when commenting. I have tried to give
examples of good comments.

## Install

    cd ~/dotfiles
    sh install.sh
